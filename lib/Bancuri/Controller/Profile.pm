# Note that 'auto' runs after 'begin' but before your actions and that
# 'auto's "chain" (all from application path to most specific class are run)
# See the 'Actions' section of 'Catalyst::Manual::Intro' for more info.
sub auto : Private {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Allow unauthenticated users to reach the login page.  This
    # allows unauthenticated users to reach any action in the Login
    # controller.  To lock it down to a single action, we could use:
    #   if ($c->action eq $c->controller('Login')->action_for('index'))
    # to only allow unauthenticated access to the 'index' action we
    # added above.

#   Not needed as /login is in another controller ;)
#    if ($c->controller eq $c->controller('Login')) {
#        return 1;
#    }

    # If a user doesn't exist, force login
    if (!$c->user_exists) {
        # Dump a log message to the development server debug output
        $c->log->debug('***Root::auto User not found, forwarding to /login');
        # Redirect the user to the login page
        $c->response->redirect('/auth/form');
        # Return 0 to cancel 'post-auto' processing and prevent use of application
        return 0;

    # User found, so return 1 to continue with processing after this 'auto'
